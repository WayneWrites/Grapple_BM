Step 1) Run BuildGame.bat
This will build all 4 builds, linux, windows, server, client etc

Step 2) Use "Steam_Upload Client & Server - Sigma" this will upload all builds to sigma for testing

Step 3) Run update_US_server_sgima - this will update one of the servers to sigma branch so you can test the thing

Once verified;

Step 4) Go to partner steam powered, and move the branches to default

Step 5) Run update_US_server.bat to update the other server 

Step 6) Proft! (Except you dont because this game burns 8 grand a year)
